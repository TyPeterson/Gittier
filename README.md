# Overview
Gittier is a CLI tool for making the landing page of a GitHub repository a little *prettier*.
By *prettier*, I mean that it hijacks the way GitHub shows commit messages next to folders/files to instead give a short description for what each folder/file contains. This is useful for being able to quickly navigate a repository and understand how it is structured. The standard commit history is still automatically preserved by the tool within the 'Development' branch. This makes it easier to separate the development history from a user-facing overview of your project which is meant to be displayed.
